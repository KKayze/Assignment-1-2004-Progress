def function1(fitmon_list):
    """
    Written By: Kayla Zevanya (32810806)

    Function Description:
    Function1 functionality is to simply create a Dynammic Programming table that will hold all the FITMONS as well as the elements that each 
    FITMONS will have such as the affinity_left value, cuteness_score, and affinity_right value. These FITMONS and the elements will need to be stored 
    within the Dynammic Programming table.

    Approach Description:
    A more detailed description of the function1 approach will be explained alongside with the code written individually by myself. But, the first approach 
    of the function is to create the Dynammic Programming table first. After the table is created to store the values of the FITMONS and each FITMONS elements, 
    the function will then use the bottom-up apporach by iterating through each row and column of the table to be able to find the highest possible cuteness score. The
    approach is only applicable by combining (or FUSING) the FITMONS only left or right of the current FITMON depending on the affinity values, such as the following example:
    
    fitmons = [
     [0, 29, 0.9],
     [0.9, 91, 0.8],
     [0.8, 48, 0.2],
     [0.2, 322, 0]
    ]
    
    Using the above example, FITMON(1) that has the values of [0.9, 91, 0.8] can either combine (or FUSE) with FITMON(0) that has the value [0, 29, 0.9] or FITMON(2) that has
    value of [0.8, 48, 0.2]. This fusion (or action) is possible by looking at the affinity_left and affinity_right value. As FITMON(0) is the first FITMON in the table and FITMON(2)
    is the second FITMON, it needs to be seen that the value of affinity_right of FITMON(0) should and MUST contain the same value as the affinity_left of FITMON(1) to be able to 
    combine (or FUSE). In simplification, the approach of the function1 is to iterate the table to combine (or FUSE) the FITMONS to the left and to the right to be able to output the 
    highest (or optimal) possible cuteness score.  

    Precondition: The function requires an array of list of a list of values.
    Postcondition: The function will output (or return) the highest possible cuteness score calculated.

    Input:
        fitmon_list = An array of a list of a list of elements that represents each FITMONS. Each FITMONS has their own values of [affinity_left, cuteness_score, affinity_right]
    Return:
        DP_table = A 2D matrix that contains the highest possible cuteness score calculated.

    Time complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^3)
        Worst case analysis: The time complexity is O(N^3) because of the three nested loop when iterating to find and calculate the highest possible cuteness score. The
        purpose of the nested loop is to fill the Dynammic Programming table with all the elements of each FITMONS and then it then iterate into the next inner loop to find the 
        starting index and most inner loop to iterate to find possible ways to obtain the optimal highest possible cuteness score.

    Space complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^2)
        Worst case analysis: The space time complexity is O(N^2) as the table takes in N which is the number of FITMONS.

    Written By: Kayla Zevanya (32810806)

    Function Description:
    The fuse function is to calculate the pre-exisiting Dynammic Programming table to determine and ONLY output the highest possible cuteness score after 
    combining (or FUSING) all the FITMONS already in the list. 

    Approach Description:
    A more detailed description of the fuse approach will be explained alongside with the code written individually by myself. The first approach of the fuse function is to create an 
    empty list that is used to store the highest possible cuteness score. The next approach of the function is to retrieve the Dynammic Programming table that has already existed in the 
    previous function "function1". From the pre-existing table, there is already the final cuteness score that has been iterated to find the optimal (or highest) possible cuteness score
    after combining (or FUSING) all the FITMONS. As the value of the optimal cuteness score is in a table, it needs to be extracted and appended into the new table to ensure that the output
    ONLY contain 1 possible output and hence, the last approach is to append the optimal cuteness score calculated in the table into the answer table.

    Precondition: The function takes in a list of FITMONS
    Postcondition: The function outputs the maximum integer value of the cuteness score

    Input:
        fitmons = A list of FITMONS where the list contains a smaller list that describes each FITMONS with their own affinity_left, cuteness_score, and affinity_right values
    Return:
        cuteness_score: The maximum (or optimal) highest possible cuteness score

    Time complexity: 
        Best case time complexity: O(N)
        Best case analysis: The best case time complexity is O(N) because the fuse function only require 1 loop to iterate just to obtain the cuteness score and append it into the 
        answer table

        Worst case time complexity: O(N^3)
        Worst case analysis: The worst case time complexity is O(N^3) because the fuse function is dependent on the pre-existing Dynammic Programming table that was created in the
        previous function1

    Space complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^2)
        Worst case analysis: The space complexity is using the pre-existing table that is created in the previous function1 which shows the space complexity is O(N^)

        Function Description:
        The function is to initialize a vertex to represent a tree in the forest. As later on, it is necessary to create a graph and within the graph there is a vertex
        and an edge, so in this function is to initialize the vertex to contain the Edges (or roads). Each vertex (or tree) will connect to other vertices (or trees) through a directed and weighted (or time) edge
        to show that there is a path (or road) from one tree to another and eventually reaching the last tree to exit the forest.

        Approach Description:
        The function will also be explained in more detailed description alongside with the code written by myself including adding an edge within this function as a list to store edges (or roads) that 
        is pointing out from the current vertex (or trees).

        The function is to initialize the edge (or road) to have properties such as to where the edge (or road) connects to the next vertex (or tree). As the assignment specification also mentions that 
        there is an amount of time needed to travel down the road (or edge) from current tree (or current vertex) to next tree (or next vertex), therefore, the function 
        also need to initialize the road (or edge) to have travel time (weight).

        Approach Description:
        The approach is to give elements or characteristic to the edge such as the weight (time) of the edge from current vertex (or current tree) to the next vertex (or next tree). The function 
        will also be explained in more detailed description alongside with the code writtren by myself.

            the trees (or vertices), the roads (or edges), and the solulus.
       
        Approach Description:

            forest (or graph). The function approaches the initialization of the graph to have a 2D adjacency list.

        Input:
            roads: The first input is the roads represented as a tuple that within it contains u,v,w where u represents the starting tree ID, v represents the ending tree ID, and w represents the amount of time 
            needed to travel down the road from tree-u to tree-v as specified in the assignment specifications.
            solulus: The second input is the solulus represented as a tuple that within it contains x,y,z where x represents the tree ID where that tree is a Solulu tree in the forest, y represents the amount of time

            The escape function is to find the optimal and shortest travel time to reach the exit from the start while adhering to the requirements of one solulu need to be destroyed. After a solulu is

            can store tuples that can store the total_time, current_vertex, and route. The function will first push or add a values of tuples within the result list which later on as long as the result list
            is still empty, the function will try to find the optimal time to visit the adjacent vertices to the current vertex and push the shortest travel time out of all the connecting vertices to the current
            vertex which later on need to check if the current vertex visited is a solulu or not, as again in the assignment specification mentioned that one solulu need to be at least visited. If the current vertex
            is a solulu, the assignment specification also mentions that it needs to be destroyed and it will take time to destroy the solulu tree and after the solulu tree is destroyed, will be teleported to a new vertex.
            The function takes into account the time taken to destroy the solulu as well to find the best and lowest optimal travel time to reach the exit.
        

        Input:
            start: The first input is the start in the form of an integer. The start is where the starting point is.
            exits: The second input is the exits in the form of a list of integers. The exits are where the exits to escape the forest is located.
           
        Output:

            get to the exit after destroying at least one solulu tree and get teleported

Considering that I have tried several test cases and all the test cases have passed with an accurate value of output as stated in the examples, I believe that 
the code has provided with the approach of obtaining optimal maximum cuteness score.

Question 2
The Test Cases Results is both referenced from the assignment specification as well as the Ed Forum 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example 1

    The output is (16, [8, 0, 2])

    # Ed forum example
    roads = [(0, 1, 1000), (1, 2, 1000), (2, 3, 1000), (3, 4, 1000), (4, 5, 1000), (0,5, 5), (0, 6, 100), (6, 4, 100)]
    solulus = [(4,1,5)]
    myforest = TreeMap(roads, solulus)
    start = 0
    exits = [5]
    q2output = myforest.escape(start, exits) 
    print(q2output)
    The output is (201, [0, 6, 4, 5])

    # Another ed forum example
    start = 0
    exits = [1,3,6,5]
    q2output = myforest.escape(start, exits) 
    print(q2output)
    The output is (201, [0, 6, 4, 5])

Considering that I have tried several test cases and majority the test cases have passed with an accurate value of output as stated in the examples, I believe that 
the code has provided with the approach of obtaining optimal shortest travel time and correct route.
