def function1(fitmon_list):

    Written By: Kayla Zevanya (32810806)

    Function Description:
    Function1 functionality is to simply create a Dynammic Programming table that will hold all the FITMONS as well as the elements that each 
    FITMONS will have such as the affinity_left value, cuteness_score, and affinity_right value. These FITMONS and the elements will need to be stored 
    within the Dynammic Programming table.

    Approach Description:
    A more detailed description of the function1 approach will be explained alongside with the code written individually by myself. But, the first approach 
    of the function is to create the Dynammic Programming table first. After the table is created to store the values of the FITMONS and each FITMONS elements, 
    the function will then use the bottom-up apporach by iterating through each row and column of the table to be able to find the highest possible cuteness score. The
    approach is only applicable by combining (or FUSING) the FITMONS only left or right of the current FITMON depending on the affinity values, such as the following example:
    
    fitmons = [
     [0, 29, 0.9],
     [0.9, 91, 0.8],
     [0.8, 48, 0.2],
     [0.2, 322, 0]
    ]
    
    Using the above example, FITMON(1) that has the values of [0.9, 91, 0.8] can either combine (or FUSE) with FITMON(0) that has the value [0, 29, 0.9] or FITMON(2) that has
    value of [0.8, 48, 0.2]. This fusion (or action) is possible by looking at the affinity_left and affinity_right value. As FITMON(0) is the first FITMON in the table and FITMON(2)
    is the second FITMON, it needs to be seen that the value of affinity_right of FITMON(0) should and MUST contain the same value as the affinity_left of FITMON(1) to be able to 
    combine (or FUSE). In simplification, the approach of the function1 is to iterate the table to combine (or FUSE) the FITMONS to the left and to the right to be able to output the 
    highest (or optimal) possible cuteness score.  

    Precondition: The function requires an array of list of a list of values.
    Postcondition: The function will output (or return) the highest possible cuteness score calculated.

    Input:
        fitmon_list = An array of a list of a list of elements that represents each FITMONS. Each FITMONS has their own values of [affinity_left, cuteness_score, affinity_right]
    Return:
        DP_table = A 2D matrix that contains the highest possible cuteness score calculated.

    Time complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^3)
        Worst case analysis: The time complexity is O(N^3) because of the three nested loop when iterating to find and calculate the highest possible cuteness score. The
        purpose of the nested loop is to fill the Dynammic Programming table with all the elements of each FITMONS and then it then iterate into the next inner loop to find the 
        starting index and most inner loop to iterate to find possible ways to obtain the optimal highest possible cuteness score.

    Space complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^2)
        Worst case analysis: The space time complexity is O(N^2) as the table takes in N which is the number of FITMONS.

    Function Description:
    The fuse function is to calculate the pre-exisiting Dynammic Programming table to determine and ONLY output the highest possible cuteness score after 
    combining (or FUSING) all the FITMONS already in the list. 

    Approach Description:
    A more detailed description of the fuse approach will be explained alongside with the code written individually by myself. The first approach of the fuse function is to create an 
    empty list that is used to store the highest possible cuteness score. The next approach of the function is to retrieve the Dynammic Programming table that has already existed in the 
    previous function "function1". From the pre-existing table, there is already the final cuteness score that has been iterated to find the optimal (or highest) possible cuteness score
    after combining (or FUSING) all the FITMONS. As the value of the optimal cuteness score is in a table, it needs to be extracted and appended into the new table to ensure that the output
    ONLY contain 1 possible output and hence, the last approach is to append the optimal cuteness score calculated in the table into the answer table.

    Precondition: The function takes in a list of FITMONS
    Postcondition: The function outputs the maximum integer value of the cuteness score

    Input:
        fitmons = A list of FITMONS where the list contains a smaller list that describes each FITMONS with their own affinity_left, cuteness_score, and affinity_right values
    Return:
        cuteness_score: The maximum (or optimal) highest possible cuteness score

    Time complexity: 
        Best case time complexity: O(N)
        Best case analysis: The best case time complexity is O(N) because the fuse function only require 1 loop to iterate just to obtain the cuteness score and append it into the 
        answer table

        Worst case time complexity: O(N^3)
        Worst case analysis: The worst case time complexity is O(N^3) because the fuse function is dependent on the pre-existing Dynammic Programming table that was created in the
        previous function1

    Space complexity: 
        Worst case time complexity: O(N^2)
        Worst case analysis: The space complexity is using the pre-existing table that is created in the previous function1 which shows the space complexity is O(N^)

Considering that I have tried several test cases and all the test cases have passed with an accurate value of output as stated in the examples, I believe that 
the code has provided with the approach of obtaining optimal maximum cuteness score.
